\title{
Assign data to clusters
}
\description{
After clustering assign additional data from a data frame with columns indicated as latitude and longitude.
}
\usage{
assign.data(cluster, points, dist=1000)
}
\arguments{
  \item{cluster}{
  The from cca() generated data frame with cluster-information.
}
  \item{points}{
    Data frame with additional data, containing at least a "lat" and "long" column with point coordinates which will be assigned.
}
  \item{dist}{
    The assignment distance given in meters. Are the given point coordinates within this distance from an identified cluster, this point will be assigned to the cluster.
}
}
\details{
Multiple points can be assigned to the same cluster. If no cluster is within the given distance, the cluster_id  will be 0.
}
\value{
Returns the data frame given as points with an additional column "cluster_id" referring to the identified cluster. A cluster_id 0 indicates that no cluster was within the given distance.
}

\examples{
data(landcover)

t <- cca(landcover, cell.class=1,s=1000, unit="m")
points <- data.frame(long=c(13.1,13.4),lat=c(52.4,52.1),name=c("Pappelhausen","Neuer Garten"))

assign.data(cluster=t$cluster, points=points, dist=1000)
