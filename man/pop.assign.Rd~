\title{
Assign population data to city clusters
}
\description{
After clustering city information, assign population data from an additional dataframe with coloumns indicated as lat and long.
}
\usage{
pop.assign(cluster, points, dist=1000)
}
\arguments{
  \item{cluster}{
  The from cca() generated dataframe with cluster-information.
}
  \item{points}{
    Dataframe with additional data, containing at least a lat and long coloumn with point coordinates which will be assigned.
}
  \item{dist}{
    The assignment distance given in meters. Are the given point coordinates within this distance from an indentified cluster, this point will be assigned to the cluster.
}
}
\details{
Multiple points can be assigned to the same Cluster. If no cluster is within the given distance, then the cluster Id  will be 0.
}
\value{
Returns the dataframe given as points with an additional coloumn cluster_id refering to the identified cluster. A cluster_id 0 indicates that no cluster was within the given distance.
